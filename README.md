# Snowball-Duel
A game which involves pitting two strategies against each other in a snowball fight with three options: "Shoot", "Reload" or "Duck". A mass tester is included to test the effectiveness of different strategies. A graphical tester is included in order to view the game. This is a team project made with my classmates.
